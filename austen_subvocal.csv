The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex .
"In the society of his nephew and niece , and their children , the old Gentleman ' s days were comfortably spent ."
His attachment to them all increased .
"By a former marriage , Mr . Henry Dashwood had one son : by his present lady , three daughters ."
"By his own marriage , likewise , which happened soon afterwards , he added to his wealth ."
"The old gentleman died : his will was read , and like almost every other will , gave as much disappointment as pleasure ."
"He meant not to be unkind , however , and , as a mark of his affection for the three girls , he left them a thousand pounds a - piece ."
"But the fortune , which had been so tardy in coming , was his only one twelvemonth ."
"He survived his uncle no longer ; and ten thousand pounds , including the late legacies , was all that remained for his widow and daughters ."
"His father was rendered easy by such an assurance , and Mr . John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might prudently be in his power to do for them ."
But Mrs . John Dashwood was a strong caricature of himself ;-- more narrow - minded and selfish .
"When he gave his promise to his father , he meditated within himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand pounds a - piece ."
He then really thought himself equal to it .
It would be enough to make them completely easy .
Three thousand pounds !
"he could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience ."""
"-- He thought of it all day long , and for many days successively , and he did not repent ."
"No sooner was his father ' s funeral over , than Mrs . John Dashwood , without sending any notice of her intention to her mother - in - law , arrived with her child and their attendants ."
"Marianne ' s abilities were , in many respects , quite equal to Elinor ' s ."
"She was sensible and clever ; but eager in everything : her sorrows , her joys , could have no moderation ."
"She was generous , amiable , interesting : she was everything but prudent ."
The resemblance between her and her mother was strikingly great .
